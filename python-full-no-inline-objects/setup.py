Samsara has endpoints available to track and analyze sensors, vehicles, and entire fleets.  The Samsara API is a [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). It uses standard [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) authentication, verbs, and response codes, and it returns [JSON](http://www.json.org/) response bodies. If you're familiar with what you can build with a REST API, then this will be your go-to API reference.  Visit [developers.samsara.com](https://developers.samsara.com) to find getting started guides and an API overview.  If you have any questions, reach out to us at [support@samsara.com](mailto:support@samsara.com).  ## Endpoints  All our APIs can be accessed through HTTP requests to URLs like:  ``` https://api.samsara.com/<endpoint> ```  For EU customers, this URL will be:  ``` https://api.eu.samsara.com/<endpoint> ```  <n class=\"warning\"> <nh> <i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-circle\"></i> Note </nh> <nb> Legacy endpoints will have the URL: `https://api.samsara.com/v1/<endpoint>` or `https://api.eu.samsara.com/v1/<endpoint>` </nb> </n>  ## Authentication  To authenticate your API request you will need to include your secret token. You can manage your API tokens in the [Dashboard](https://cloud.samsara.com). They are visible under `Settings->Organization->API Tokens`.  Your API tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure. Do not share your secret API tokens in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so on.  Authentication to the API is performed via Bearer Token in the HTTP Authorization header. Provide your API token as the `access_token` value in an `Authorization: Bearer` header. You do not need to provide a password:  ```curl Authorization: Bearer {access_token} ```  All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). Calls made over plain HTTP or without authentication will fail.  ## Common Patterns  You can find more info about request methods, response codes, error codes, versioning, pagination, timestamps, and mini-objects [here](https://developers.samsara.com/docs/common-structures).   # noqa: E501
